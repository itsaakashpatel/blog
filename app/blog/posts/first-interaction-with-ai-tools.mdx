Times have changed and now we are in the era of Artificial Intelligence. AI tools are becoming an integral part of our daily lives, and I am no exception to this trend. My journey with AI tools has been nothing short of transformative, both personally and professionally.

Especially in the field of software development, AI tools have transformed the way we work, making tasks more efficient and allowing us to focus on what truly matters: creativity and problem-solving.

Yes! Correct, creativity and problem-solving.

In this article, I just want to share my experience/learnings/tips and tricks with copilot, claude code, LLM models etc. and how they are impacting the way I work and think.

# Beginning:

- Earlier, we used to write code manually, time consuming and we got paid for it to think and eventually to solve the problems through code and tech available to our disposal.
- Code was the monopoly of developers, but more that code, it was the thought process that mattered.
- We were developing our thought process in the mind, then trying to implement through code. Still, we were not sure if it was the best way to solve the problem.

- ENTER THE WORLD OF AI TOOLS:
  - AI tools like Copilot, Claude Code, and other LLM models have revolutionized the way we approach coding.
  - They assist in writing code, suggesting improvements, and even debugging, which saves a lot of time and effort.
  - These tools analyze vast amounts of data to provide insights and suggestions that we might not have considered.
  - The best part is that they are not just limited to code generation; they also help in understanding the problem better and finding optimal solutions.

# My Experience with AI Tools:

- I'm just getting started with all these tools and I have already seen a significant improvement in my productivity and the quality of my work. 
- It helps to focus on what truly matters: creativity and problem-solving.
- It also helps me to search web faster, questioning my own thought process, and finding/suggesting better solutions. (In some cases only!!)
- They are not just another tools; they are assistants that enhance our capabilities and allow us to achieve more in less time.

- I started with Copilot, integrated it with my IDE, obviously it was free for some time, and good enough to get started. I started giving some instructions to perform taks and update the code.
- Failed!!!
- What I wanted to get was not what I got. I was not able to get the expected results but I was mind blown by the capabilities of the tool.
- Moving forward, I learned it all boils down to how you ask the question and give more context.
- Also, it also matters which LLM model you are using. More on this later.
- After trial and error, I found out more the context you provide, better the results you get. But the issue with this approach is that it consumes a lot of tokens and you end up paying a lot.
- You have to focus on token consumption and how to optimize it along with proving enough context.
  
So far I have used Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor with LLM models like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.1, Antrophic sonnet 3.7 and 4. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but they all are good enough to produce code and helping you to solve problems.
