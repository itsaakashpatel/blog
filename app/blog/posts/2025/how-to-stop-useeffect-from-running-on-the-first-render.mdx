In certain situations, you want to skip the first render of the `useEffect` hook. Currently, we don’t have any mechanism built or hook defined by React Team which does the job for us.

## What is useEffect?

`useEffect` is a React Hook that lets you perform side effects in function components. Side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, manually changing the DOM, and more. The `useEffect` hook runs after the component renders, and you can control when it runs by specifying dependencies.

## How do we use useEffect?

**Actually, In React, the** [`useEffect` **hook**](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) **runs after every render cycle of the component.**

Not aware of that?? So here’s the catch. For example.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (searchText) getSearchTextData(searchText);
}, [searchText]);
```

Here, I added the `useEffects` block and `searchText` in the dependency array. Ideally, when searchText will change, the `useEffect` hook should be triggered.

You are right. It will trigger when `searchText` will be changed. But It also gets triggered when you render the component for the first time.

This means the `useEffect` block gets called on every render cycle of any component.

However, there may be cases where you want to skip the first `useEffect` call and only execute it on subsequent updates. That means controlling when the useEffect Hook runs.

In this guide, I will share a custom hook that skips `useEffect` from running on the first render but allows code execution on subsequent renders.

## Using useRef to skip the initial useEffect run

One way to achieve this is by using a `ref` to keep track of whether the component is mounting or not.

You can set the initial value of the ref to `true`, and then set it to `false` after the first `useEffect` call.

**For example:**

```js
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const exampleComponent = () => {
  const checkFirstRender = useRef(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (checkFirstRender.current) {
      checkFirstRender.current = false;
      return;
    }
    // Rest useEffect code here for subsequent updates
  });

  // Rest component code here
};
```

In this example, the `checkFirstRender` ref is initialized to `true`. In the useEffect callback, if `checkFirstRender.current` is `true`, we skip the rest of the function and set the `checkFirstRender.current` to `false`. On subsequent updates, the rest of the useEffect code will execute as It should.

By using this approach, you can effectively skip the first useEffect call in React. Now, let me show you how to define it as a custom hook.

## A custom hook – useSkipFirstRender

```js
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

function useSkipFirstRender(callback, dependencies) {
  const firstRenderRef = useRef(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (firstRenderRef.current) {
      firstRenderRef.current = false;
      return;
    }
    callback();
  }, dependencies);
}

export default useSkipFirstRender;
```

Here, I have defined one function `useSkipFirstRender` with two params `callback` and `dependencies`. As I showed you previously, I have used the `useRef` hook to manage the value of the first render.

**The callback function will be the rest of the code inside the useEffect hook. While dependencies will be an array of values on which useEffect should be called.**

Now, our main example can be rewritten in this way.

```js
useSkipFirstRender(() => {
  getSearchTextData(searchText);
}, [searchText]);
```
