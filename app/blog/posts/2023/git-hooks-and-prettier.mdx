When you are working in a team, you need to maintain the quality of the code. It should be easy to read and formatting should be neat and clean. Right?

It holds significant practical value and it’s essential because of readability, consistency, smooth collaboration, debugging, and maintainability.

Properly formatted code helps developers to easily read and understand the flow of the code.

In this article, I’m going to show you how to format your code using prettier and git hooks before you commit.

## What is prettier?

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent code style in your project. It analyzes your code and automatically adjusts the formatting to match your predefined rules.

it’s available for most IDEs and you can also add it as an npm or yarn package.

## What is husky?

[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) is a tool that manages Git hooks in your repository, ensuring that specific scripts or actions run at various stages of the Git lifecycle, such as pre-commit or pre-push.

## How to set up prettier and husky for the project?

You can set up Git hooks to run Prettier before each commit to ensure that the code adheres to your formatting standards. To do this, you can use a combination of Git hooks and Husky. Here are the steps to set up Git hooks for Prettier:

### #1: Install Prettier and Husky:

First, make sure you have Prettier and Husky installed as development dependencies in your project:

```js
npm install --save-dev prettier husky
```

### #2: Create a Prettier Configuration File:

Create a `.prettierrc` or `.prettierrc.json` file in the root of your project. Something like this:

```js
{
  "printWidth": 100,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "bracketSpacing": false
}
```

### #3: Define the script command in the `package.json` file.

Here, I have defined format and lint commands. You can use npm run format to beautify your code according to defined rules.

```js
"scripts": {
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "lint": "prettier --check ."
  },
```

### #4: Use husky and git hooks to check the formatting of code before committing to GitHub.

There are many git hooks available you can [check them](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) here. Here, I’m using the `pre-commit` rule which will run before each commit.

In your `package.json` file.

```js
"husky": {
  "hooks": {
    "pre-commit": "npm run format && git add -A ."
  }
}
```

Your final `package.json` file should look something similar to this:

```js
{
  "name": "quote-flora",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "expo start",
    "android": "expo start --android",
    "ios": "expo start --ios",
    "web": "expo start --web",
    "format": "prettier --write .",
    "lint": "prettier --check ."
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "npm run format && git add -A ."
    }
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^6.5.11",
    "@react-navigation/native": "^6.1.9",
    "@react-navigation/native-stack": "^6.9.16",
    "@react-navigation/stack": "^6.3.20",
    "expo": "^49.0.16",
    "expo-notifications": "~0.20.1",
    "expo-permissions": "^14.4.0",
    "expo-status-bar": "~1.6.0",
    "material-icons": "^1.13.12",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-native": "^0.72.6",
    "react-native-paper": "^5.11.0",
    "react-native-reanimated": "^3.5.4",
    "react-native-segmented-control-tab": "^4.0.0",
    "react-native-tab-view": "^3.5.2",
    "react-native-vector-icons": "^10.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/core": "^7.20.0",
    "husky": "^8.0.3",
    "prettier": "^3.0.3"
  },
  "private": true
}
```

That’s it. Now every time you commit your code it will run npm run format to format the code and then it will be committed.

## Few things to keep in mind:

1: Ensure that you have initialized Git in your project and that you are working within a Git repository. If you’re not in a Git repository, Husky won’t work.

2: Ensure that you have staged the files you intend to commit. Husky and lint-staged will only run Prettier on files that are already staged with `git add .`.

3: If Husky or lint-staged are running but not applying Prettier, check the output in your terminal when you attempt to make a commit. Any error messages or warnings might provide clues about what’s going wrong.

Thanks!
