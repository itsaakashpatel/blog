Hi, I'm Aakash.

I've been fascinated by technology & tinkering with gadgets since I was a kid – I remember in 7th grade when my friend's laptop completely died the night before his final exam presentation and I opened it up, reseated the RAM stick that had come loose, and had it running perfectly in 10 minutes.

From there, I kept fixing more computers and laptops for friends and relatives, which deepened my interest in technology and problem-solving. That curiosity led me to become a Software Engineer.

You know how businesses often struggle with technology that doesn't quite solve their real problems? Well, I'm the person who digs deep into those customer pain points and builds tech solutions that actually work.

What sets me apart is that I don't just write code – I focus on delivering outcomes that matter to business.

Whether it's scaling applications for millions of users or optimizing performance to save time and money, I try to look at every business aspect that can impact and improve the business.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking, traveling, sharing technical insights through my blog posts, or discussing ideas over coffee – I believe the best solutions come from collaboration and continuous learning.
